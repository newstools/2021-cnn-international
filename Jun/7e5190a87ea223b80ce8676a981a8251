(CNN)In a Hong Kong warehouse, a swarm of autonomous robots works 24/7. They're not just working hard, they're working smart; as they operate, they get better at their job. The Autonomous Mobile Robots were developed by Chinese startup Geek+. As they move around the warehouse they're guided by QR codes on the floor, and using AI they are able to make their own decisions, including what direction to travel and what route to take to their destination.  A team tracks these movements and uses the data to improve their algorithms, making the robots more efficient. Robots have become commonplace in warehouses worldwide and Geek+ says it has more than 15,000 robots in over 30 countries, including in Nike and Decathlon warehouses. Managing director Lit Fung says having robots that become more efficient over time helps companies meet demands for fast delivery, as well as reducing labor costs and human error. "Everyone is looking for an automation solution to apply to their warehouse," he says. Watch the video for the full story.
