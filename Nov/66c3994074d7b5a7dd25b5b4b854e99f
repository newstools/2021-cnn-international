London (CNN)British vocalist and founding member of UB40 Terence Wilson, better known by his stage name Astro, has died after a short illness, his current band confirmed. "We are absolutely devastated and completely heartbroken to have to tell you that our beloved Astro has today passed away after a very short illness," a statement on Ali Campbell and Astro's Twitter account said on Saturday. "The world will never be the same without him." Wilson was part of British reggae band UB40 for more than 30 years, before leaving the band to join breakaway group UB40 featuring Ali Campbell and Astro in 2013. UB40 formed in Birmingham in the late 1970s, and over the next three decades found success with hits including "Red Red Wine" and "(I Can't Help) Falling In Love."
