(CNN)Someone apparently forgot to tell Priyanka Chopra Jonas that there's speculation she and Nick Jonas are having marital issues. It all started when the actress/producer dropped "Jonas" from her name on her Instagram and Twitter accounts. That began chatter that the star couple may have split. But then on Monday Nick Jonas posted a video on his Instagram account showing him working out with some weights as he did bicep curls. His wife had quite the reaction. "Damn! I just died in your arms..." she wrote in the comments, along with three emoticons including a face with heart eyes. The couple married in 2018.
