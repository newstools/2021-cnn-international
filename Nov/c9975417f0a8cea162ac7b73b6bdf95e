A couple of high-profile trials have been taking place in the United States this week. In Kenosha, Wisconsin, 18-year-old Kyle Rittenhouse is on trial for the shooting deaths of two people last year. Rittenhouse took the stand on Wednesday and said he fired his rifle in self-defense while people were protesting the police shooting of Jacob Blake. Meanwhile, in Brunswick, Georgia, three White men are charged with the killing of Ahmaud Arbery, a 25-year-old Black man. They have pleaded not guilty. Here are some of the other stories that made headlines from November 5-11, as well as some photos that caught our eye.
