(CNN)Former Japanese Princess Mako moved to the United States on Sunday with her newlywed husband, commoner Kei Kumuro, after Mako exited Japan's royal family, Japanese public broadcaster NHK reported. The couple, who got married on October 26 in a subdued ceremony, departed from Tokyo's Haneda Airport on Sunday morning. They will rent an apartment in New York, where Komuro is employed as a clerk at a law firm, according to the NHK. The newlyweds are said to have expressed gratitude to the imperial family and people who supported them before leaving. Mako, who turned 30 in October, announced her engagement with Komuro four years ago. But their union has been plagued by years of controversy, public disapproval and tabloid frenzy over a money scandal involving Komuro's mother. In an effort to appease a disapproving public, Mako turned down a one-off million-dollar payout from the government, which she was entitled to as a departing royal. At a press event after their marriage ceremony last month, the newlyweds apologized for any trouble caused by their marriage and expressed gratitude to those who supported them. "To me, Kei is a very important, indispensable existence," Mako said. "Mako and I would like to build a warm, nice family," Komuro said. "Happy times, unhappy times, we would like to be together, and we will be indispensable to each other." In October, Komuro failed the New York state bar exam, but he said he will continue to study and retake the test in February.
