The US Food and Drug Administration issued emergency use authorization on Friday, October 29, for Pfizer's Covid-19 vaccine for children aged 5 to 11. Pfizer says a clinical trial showed its vaccine provides more than 90% protection against symptomatic disease among children, even at one-third the dose, and the company hopes the lower dose will reduce the risk of any side effects. Within days of the authorization, families were jumping at the chance to vaccinate their children. Here are some of the other stories that made headlines from October 29 to November 4, as well some photos that caught our eye.
