New York (CNN Business)Procter & Gamble Co. issued a recall for more than a dozen Old Spice and Secret-branded aerosol deodorants and sprays, warning that the products could contain benzene, a cancer-causing agent. The recall notice, published earlier this week, noted that the affected products likely will not expose people to levels of benzene high enough to cause health issues. The company added it has not "received any reports of adverse events," but it's moving forward with the recall out of "an abundance of caution." "Exposure to benzene can occur by inhalation, orally, and through the skin and it can result in cancers, including leukemia and blood cancer of the bone marrow and blood disorders which can be life-threatening," the recall notice said. P&G (PG) wants people who purchased the affected products — which were sold in stores across the United States, as well as online — to throw them away, and the company is offering full refunds. Customers can fill out an online form or contact a hotline at 888-339-7689 Monday through Friday from 9 am to 6 pm ET. Retailers have been told to remove the products from shelves. The recall includes the following products with an expiration date before September 2023: Old Spice High Endurance AP Spray Pure SportOld Spice Hardest Working Collection Invisible Spray Stronger SwaggerOld Spice Hardest Working Collection Invisible Spray Pure Sport PlusOld Spice Hardest Working Collection Invisible Spray Stronger SwaggerOld Spice Hardest Working Collection Invisible Spray Ultimate CaptainOld Spice Below Deck Powder Spray UnscentedOld Spice Below Deck Powder Spray Fresh AirSecret Aerosol Powder Fresh Twin PackSecret Aerosol Powder Fresh Secret Aerosol Powder FreshSecret Fresh Collection Invisible Spray WaterlilySecret Fresh Collection Invisible Spray LavenderSecret Fresh Collection Invisible Spray Light EssentialsSecret Fresh Collection Invisible Spray RoseSecret Outlast Invisible Spray Completely CleanSecret Outlast Invisible Spray Protecting PowderOld Spice Pure Sport 2021 Gift Set This isn't the first benzene-related recall of 2021.
