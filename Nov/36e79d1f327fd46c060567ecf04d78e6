(CNN)Dwayne "The Rock" Johnson wants to do his part to make production sets safer. While promoting his upcoming movie "Red Notice," Johnson told Variety that he will no longer allow real guns on the set of any of his Seven Bucks film productions after the fatal shooting on the set of "Rust," which killed cinematographer Halyna Hutchins. "We're going to switch over to rubber guns, and we're going to take care of it in post[-production]. We're not going to worry about the dollars. We won't worry about what it costs," he said. "I was heartbroken. We lost a life. My heart goes out to her family and everybody on set. I've known Alec, too, for a very long time," Johnson added. Johnson's comments come amid growing calls to ban functional firearms on Hollywood sets. An active investigation is underway to determine how the firearm discharged by actor and producer Alec Baldwin on the "Rust" set last month became loaded with a suspected live round. An assistant director on the film yelled "cold gun," indicating the weapon did not have live rounds, before handing the firearm to Baldwin, according to an affidavit in the case. Baldwin has been in phone contact with detectives, willingly answering their questions, law enforcement and the actor have said.
