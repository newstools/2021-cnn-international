(CNN)Dolly Parton is showing her love for her husband of 55 years, Carl Thomas Dean. The legendary singer, who turned 75 this year, took to Instagram with a throwback picture of herself and Dean holding hands. Dean has a (seemingly photoshopped) Dolly Parton T-shirt on. "Find you a partner who will support you like my Carl Dean does!" Parton wrote. Fans loved the picture, with one writing, "Carl Dean is super handsome!" Another commented, "What a love story." Parton first met Dean at a Nashville laundromat the day after she arrived in the city. The two renewed their wedding vows in 2016 for their 50th anniversary. Parton's post is a promotion for the Dolly Vintage Collage Tee, which is currently on sale for $35 on her website.
