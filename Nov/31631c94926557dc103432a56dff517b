A jury on Wednesday found three men guilty of murdering Ahmaud Arbery, ending a highly publicized trial that was seeped in issues such as race and the rights and limitations of self-defense. Arbery, a 25-year-old Black man, was jogging near Brunswick, Georgia, when he was chased by three White men and fatally shot in February 2020. Video of the episode surfaced more than two months later, sparking widespread demonstrations. A sentencing date has not yet been set for the three convicted men:  Travis McMichael, Gregory McMichael and William "Roddie" Bryan Jr. Their attorneys have said they planned to appeal. Here are some of the other stories that made headlines from November 19-25, as well as some photos that caught our eye.
