(CNN)"You" star Penn Badgley is weighing in on Laura Ingraham's viral "You" moment. On Tuesday, Ingraham misunderstood FOX News contributor Raymond Arroyo when he referenced Badgley's Netflix show, thinking he was talking about her. Arroyo brought up the show while talking about woke culture, and mentioned an episode involving measles. Ingraham replied with, "Wait, wait, wait — when did I mention measles?" "I don't know. It was on You," Arroyo replied. Ingraham then asked "What was on me?" This went on for nearly two minutes, as Ingraham continued to deny she ever had measles and Arroyo trying to explain. "There's a show called 'You' on Netflix," Arroyo said, to which Ingraham responded, "There's a show called Laura Ingraham on Netflix?" The clip made its way to Badgley, with the actor tweeting, "It's gotta be a bit. Dude is committed, he actually made me lol, but watch how he waits for her to cut him off." Then Netflix joined the fun replying to Badgley's tweet, "100% a bit." "Thanks @PennBadgley! (Your delivery is pretty great as well.)," Arroyo replied. "Now please don't #YouNetflix kill all my friends!!"
