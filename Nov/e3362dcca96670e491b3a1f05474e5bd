FW de Klerk, the last leader of apartheid-era South Africa who shared a Nobel Peace Prize with Nelson Mandela after working to end racial segregation in the country, has died at 85, his foundation said on Thursday, November 11. De Klerk released Mandela, who'd become his successor, from prison and negotiated a transition to democracy, ending a decadeslong segregationist system that kept South Africa's White minority in power over the Black majority for generations. The two men shared the peace prize in 1993 for their work to end the policy. De Klerk died at his home in Fresnaye from mesothelioma cancer, according to his foundation.
