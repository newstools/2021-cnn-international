(CNN)At least 30 people entered a Best Buy store in Burnsville, Minnesota, on Black Friday and stole electronics, according to a Burnsville Police statement obtained by CNN affiliate WCCO. No one was injured and no weapons were drawn during the incident that occurred shortly after 8 p.m. in the city, approximately 15 miles south of Minneapolis, police say.  It is not yet known how much merchandise was taken from the store in Friday's theft, the statement said.

The suspects had already left the store by the time police got there, the city said in a release. Maplewood police are investigating whether this theft is related to the one in the Burnsville Best Buy. The police said earlier that there were six people involved in the Maplewood theft.
