(CNN)HOV is officially on the gram. Jay-Z, who is well known for not being very active on social media, launched an Instagram account on Tuesday. The rapper/entrepreneur/anything else he wants to be stayed true to his minimalist approach with a single photo, the poster art for the new Netflix film "The Harder They Fall," and an IG Story, featuring a countdown for the Black Western's premiere on the streaming service. He serves as a producer on the project, which stars Jonathan Majors, Idris Elba and Regina King. Jay-Z also curated the film's soundtrack with music by him, naturally. As of Wednesday, the account -- which sports a back-in-the-day photo of the rapper as his profile pic -- was quickly approaching 2 million followers. But don't expect him to be all over the place liking photos. Jay-Z is only following one person: His equally famous and productive wife, Beyoncé.
