(CNN)Rihanna's homeland wants her to continue to "shine bright like a diamond." The singer was honored Monday in her native Barbados during its presidential inauguration, which served to mark the country becoming a republic. Barbadian Prime Minister Mia Mottley told the crowd, "On behalf of a grateful nation, but an even prouder people, we therefore present to you the designee for national hero of Barbados, Ambassador Robyn Rihanna Fenty." "May you continue to shine like a diamond and bring honor to your nation by your works, by your actions and to do credit wherever you shall go," Mottley said. The makeup and fashion mogul was appointed as an ambassador of Barbados in 2018. According to a statement from the Barbados Government Information Office released at the time, the position gives the celeb "specific responsibility for promoting education, tourism and investment for the island." She also became one of the Caribbean island country's cultural ambassadors in 2008, doing promotional work for its tourism ministry. In a move that received a great deal of support in the country, Barbados formally cut ties with the British monarchy by becoming a republic almost 400 years after the first English ship arrived on the most easterly of the Caribbean islands.
