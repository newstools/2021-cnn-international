(CNN)The quiet English town of Maidenhead wouldn't rank very highly on a list of places you would expect to see Hollywood superstars. But Rob McElhenney and Ryan Reynolds shocked football fans on Tuesday evening by turning up unexpectedly at York Road, the home stadium of fifth-tier side Maidenhead United FC. The pair were there to watch Wrexham AFC in person for the first time since taking 100% control of the club back in February. McElhenney, the co-creator of "It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia," and Reynolds, star of "Deadpool," made an initial £2 million ($2.77M) investment into the Welsh club.

After falling 2-0 behind early on and then having a man sent off, Wrexham looked set to produce an unlikely comeback that wouldn't look out of place in a Hollywood script. However, Maidenhead's numerical advantage eventually took hold as the home side scored the winning goal midway through the second half. "We didn't want our first win to be away anyway," McElhenney wrote on Twitter after the match. "Congrats to @MUFCYorkRoad on a tough game. See you at Y Cae Ras," he ended, the Welsh name for Wrexham's home stadium, The Racecourse Ground. The pair only have to wait until Saturday, when Wrexham hosts Torquay United in the National League.
