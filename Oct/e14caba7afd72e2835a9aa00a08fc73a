Russian newspaper editor Dmitry Muratov has been awarded the 2021 Nobel Peace Prize along with Filipino American journalist Maria Ressa. Ressa is the CEO of Rappler, a news outlet critical of Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte's regime, while Muratov heads the independent Russian newspaper Novaya Gazeta. Both have faced legal and physical threats during their careers as their respective governments cracked down on the rights of journalists. Six staff members at the Novaya Gazeta have been killed since Muratov co-founded the outlet in 1993, according to the Norwegian Nobel Committee. He has served as the paper's editor-in-chief since 1995. Reacting to his win, Muratov said the prize is a testament to the newspaper's dedication to free speech and his colleagues who have died fighting for it, Russian state media TASS reported.
