(CNN)Count LeBron James among those caught up in "Squid Game." The basketball icon's thoughts were shared in a video tweeted by sports writer Kyle Goon. "I didn't like the ending though," James told Lakers teammate Anthony Davis. The hit Netflix's series creator Hwang Dong-hyuk was asked for his reaction to that by The Guardian. "Have you seen 'Space Jam 2'?" he said. "LeBron James is cool and can say what he wants. I respect that. I'm very thankful he watched the whole series. But I wouldn't change my ending." Slam dunk, sir. "Squid Game" has become an international phenomenon with its plot about a group of poor contestants who must play a deadly competition of children's games in an attempt to get out of debt.
