US President Joe Biden said Monday that the climate crisis is the "the existential threat to human existence as we know it," and he urged world leaders to come together to reduce emissions and save the planet. Biden was speaking at COP26, a climate summit in Glasgow, Scotland. More than 120 world leaders attended the conference. "Let this be the start of a decade of transformative action that preserves our planet and raises the quality of life for people everywhere," Biden said in his speech. "We can do this. We just have to make choice to do it. So let's get to work." Glasgow was the last stop on Biden's second foreign trip as President. He started it Friday by meeting with Pope Francis at the Vatican, and then he attended the Group of 20 Summit in Rome over the weekend.
