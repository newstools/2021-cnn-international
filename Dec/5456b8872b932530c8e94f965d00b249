(CNN Business)Lyft is giving its employees another year to work remotely, a dramatic step among major businesses that are continuing to delay a return to the office. The rideshare company said Wednesday that it won't require its staff to return to the office until 2023. Lyft did not cite concerns about the new Omicron coronavirus variant in its statement, instead pointing to the "flexibility" desired by its employees. "We've heard from our team members that they value continued flexibility in determining where they work and would benefit from additional time to plan," said Ashley Adams, a Lyft spokesperson. "We want to give people a choice for all of next year." Adams said the company's offices are still set to reopen in February, but working from the office will be optional for the entirety of 2022. "We're already seeing an increasing number of team members choose to work from the office, and we're excited to offer more opportunities for those interested in getting together," Adams said. A number of companies have pushed back their return to office date, though Lyft (LYFT) is arguably the longest for a high-profile company. On Monday, Ford (F) pushed its return-to-office date to March over new Covid-19 concerns. Meanwhile, The Washington Post reported that Google and Uber (UBER) have postponed their return-to-office dates indefinitely. The Wall Street Journal reported earlier this week that Facebook parent Meta (FB) "will fully reopen its U.S. offices at the end of January, but will give workers a chance to delay their scheduled return as late as June."
