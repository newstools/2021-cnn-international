The Omicron Covid-19 variant is now the most dominant strain in the United States, accounting for over 73% of new coronavirus cases less than three weeks after the first was reported, according to estimates posted Monday, December 20, by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Scientists are still waiting on data on the severity of Omicron compared to other variants in the country. But it is expected to put added strain on the health care system and health care workers especially. With the Delta and Omicron variants spreading across the nation as the new year approaches, health experts are urging Americans to get vaccinated or boosted to protect themselves and others before they face greater chances of infection. As the virus spreads, more cities are adding restrictions, including New York and Washington, DC. See images from this month showing affected areas around the country.
