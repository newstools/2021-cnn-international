(CNN)In just a few years, a Dubai fitness-gear startup has gone from a local to a global brand. Squatwolf produces premium gym clothing for dedicated athletes. "We don't make gear for people who go for the first time to the gym," says Wajdan Gul, the company's CEO and co-founder. "We do it for athletes, with a true athletic fit." Wajdan launched the brand in 2016 with his wife Anam Khalid, but since the get-go they faced a daunting challenge: getting their brand known while competing with the likes of Nike, Reebok and Under Armour. To succeed, they rolled out a marketing strategy that used trainers as micro-influencers to promote the brand on social media. "We went to the gyms and asked personal trainers if they wanted to support a local brand," says Anam. It's a strategy that has benefited the company's growth and credibility. Having started in Dubai five years ago, Squatwolf now sells in more than 120 countries, showing how a tailored and localized marketing strategy can help small, ambitious startups thrive in the global market.
