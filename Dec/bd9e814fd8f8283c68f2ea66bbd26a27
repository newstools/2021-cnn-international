(CNN)Jim Bob and Michelle Duggar have shared a statement about their son's conviction on child pornography charges. On Thursday, Josh Duggar, 33, was found guilty of downloading and possessing child sex abuse images. His parents called the experience "grievous."

Our hearts and prayers are with anyone who has ever been harmed through CSAM (child sex abuse material)." The couple, who starred on TLC's "19 Kids and Counting," continued: "In the days ahead, we will do all we can to surround our daughter-in-law Anna and their children with love and support. As parents, we will never stop praying for Joshua, and loving him, as we do all of our children. In each of life's circumstances, we place our trust in God. He is our source of strength and refuge. Thank you for your prayers." Josh Duggar and his wife Anna share seven children.
