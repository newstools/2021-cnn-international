(CNN)Kim Kardashian has passed a law exam and moved a step closer to being able to practice as an attorney in the state of California. Kardashian revealed that she passed the exam at the fourth attempt in an Instagram post published Monday. "OMFGGGG I PASSED THE BABY BAR EXAM!!!!," Kardashian wrote, alongside an image of herself in a bright blue dress, looking into a mirror. "Looking in the mirror, I am really proud of the woman looking back today in the reflection," the post reads. "For anyone who doesn't know my law school journey, know this wasn't easy or handed to me." Kardashian said she was suffering with Covid-19 during one attempt to pass the exam, which is one of two she needs to pass in order to become a practicing attorney in California. "I was told by top lawyers that this was a close to impossible journey and harder than the traditional law school route but it was my only option and it feels so so sooooo good to be here and on my way to achieving my goals," she wrote. Kardashian went on to thank CNN commentator Van Jones for persuading her to study law, as well as lawyers Jessica Jackson and Edy Haney and her professors, Sam Farkas and Chuck Shonholtz. Referring to her late father, Robert Kardashian, an attorney famous for defending O.J. Simpson during his murder trial, she wrote: "I know my dad would be so proud and he would actually be so shocked to know that this is my path now but he would have been my best study partner." Kardashian ended the post with a positive message to fans working toward their own goals. "Bottom line is don't ever give up even when you are holding on by a thread, you can do it!!!!!" she wrote. "Set your mind to it and get it done because it feels soooooo good once you get to the other side!" Those who want to become attorneys in California have to pass exams certified by the State Bar of California. The state bar declined to comment on Kardashian's exam result to CNN, saying individual results were confidential.
