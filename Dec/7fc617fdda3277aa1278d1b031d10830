Former Nevada Sen. Harry Reid has died at the age of 82, according to a statement released on Tuesday by his wife Landra Reid. "I am heartbroken to announce the passing of my husband, former Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid. He died peacefully this afternoon, surrounded by our family, following a courageous, four-year battle with pancreatic cancer," she said in the statement. Reid served in the US Senate for 20 years before retiring in 2017. The Nevada native led the Senate Democratic Caucus for 12 of those years, serving spells as both the Senate majority leader (2007-2015) and the Senate minority leader (2005-2007 and 2015-2017). Before he was elected to the Senate, Reid served two terms in the US House of Representatives.
