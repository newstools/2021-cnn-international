New York (CNN Business)Procter & Gamble has recalled more than 30 aerosol spray haircare products, including many dry shampoos and dry conditioners, warning that the products could contain benzene, a cancer-causing agent. The affected items include assorted Pantene, Herbal Essences, Hair Food, Old Spice and Aussie products, according to Friday's recall notice, which is P&G's second within a month. A full list of recalled products is available on the company's website, including the production code numbers affected by the recall. P&G said in a statement that the affected products likely will not expose people to levels of benzene high enough to cause health issues. However, the company noted it has not "received any reports of adverse events," but it's moving forward with the recall out of "an abundance of caution." "Exposure to benzene can occur by inhalation, orally, and through the skin and it can result in cancers, including leukemia and blood cancer of the bone marrow and blood disorders which can be life-threatening," the recall notice said. Retailers have been told to remove the recalled products from shelves. P&G (PG) wants people who purchased the affected products, which were sold in stores across the United States as well as online, to throw them away. The company is offering full refunds, and customers can fill out an online form or contact a hotline at 1-888-674-36319 Monday through Friday from 9 am to 6 pm ET. The Food and Drug Administration has been alerted of this recall, the agency said. P&G added that no other products from those lines are in the "scope of this recall and such other products may continue to be used as intended, including those aerosol dry shampoo spray products with production code ranges different from those specifically communicated." In November, P&G issued a similar recall for more than a dozen Old Spice and Secret-branded aerosol deodorants and sprays, warning that the products could contain also benzene. In July, Johnson & Johnson (JNJ) recalled some spray-on Neutrogena and Aveeno sunscreens after it detected low levels of the carcinogen in the products.
