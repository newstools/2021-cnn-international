(CNN)French side Troyes has alleged that South Korean striker Suk Hyun-jun was racially abused during the club's game against Marseille on Sunday. Troyes said the abuse was picked up by the microphones of the Amazon Prime broadcast of the match, which was played behind closed doors and finished 1-0 to Marseille. A statement said: "These remarks are simply unacceptable and come to mar a sport, football, which is essentially multicolored and multicultural.

Ligue 1 confirmed that the LFP, French football's governing body, will investigate the case. In a statement, Marseille said it joins Troyes in "firmly condemning the remarks" about Suk. "Football is a cosmopolitan field, rich in the diversity of its platforms and of all its players. And it is together that we will continue to fight relentlessly to eradicate this calamity," the club added. "OM also offers its full support to (Suk). The presidents of the two clubs exchanged views in a calm atmosphere and the Olympique club, through its president Pablo Longoria, undertakes to ask the perpetrators for explanations and to take the necessary measures."
