(CNN)Betty White says Ryan Reynolds just can't quit her. The two starred in the 2009 movie "The Proposal," and ever since Reynolds has been publicly calling White his "ex-girlfriend." The iconic actress responded in an interview with People, saying, "I've heard Ryan can't get over his thing for me, but Robert Redford is The One."

The movie follows White behind-the-scenes on sets, working with her office staff, entertaining at home and will include her actual birthday party.
