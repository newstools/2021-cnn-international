(CNN)With age comes more support for vaccine mandates, polling shows. No matter your political affiliation, if you're over 45 years old, you're more likely to say vaccine mandates for everyday activities are an acceptable way to increase vaccination rates, according to a new poll from CNN, conducted by SSRS. Meaning that despite an ongoing partisan split over Covid-19 mitigation efforts, the generational divide extends beyond party lines. CNN's Ariel Edwards-Levy breaks it down: "Democrats 45 and older are 10 percentage points likelier than younger Democrats to say that mandates for everyday activities are an acceptable way to increase vaccination rates, with a similar 11-point split between younger and older independents. Republicans 45 and older are 13 points likelier than younger Republicans to say the same." Of course, those deep partisan divides persist, as this and so many other polls show. Just a quarter of Republicans consider vaccine mandates acceptable (26%) while a whopping 82% of Democrats say vaccine mandates are acceptable. And three-quarters of Democrats say the government can take effective action against the pandemic, while just one-third of Republicans say the same, CNN found. The Point: Americans' views on vaccine mandates still differ largely on party lines. But there are generational divides within the parties, too.
