More than 30 tornadoes were reported across six states late Friday and early Saturday, killing dozens of people and leaving a trail of devastation. The severe weather collapsed an occupied candle factory in Kentucky, an Amazon warehouse in western Illinois, and a nursing home in Arkansas, killing people at each site and leaving responders scrambling to rescue survivors. "The level of devastation is unlike anything I have ever seen," said Kentucky Gov. Andy Beshear.
