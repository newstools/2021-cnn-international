Many viewers were distraught, taking to social media to blast the show for such a tragic way to kick off the reboot. A Peloton representative even responded to the unexpected storyline in a statement to the Los Angeles Times. "'SATC' fans, like me, are saddened by the news that Mr. Big dies of a heart attack," Dr. Suzanne Steinbaum, a member of Peloton's health and wellness advisory council and a preventative cardiologist told the LA Times. "Mr. Big lived what many would call an extravagant lifestyle — including cocktails, cigars, and big steaks — and was at serious risk as he had a previous cardiac event in Season 6." "These lifestyle choices and perhaps even his family history, which often is a significant factor, were the likely cause of his death. Riding his Peloton Bike may have even helped delay his cardiac event," Steinbaum added. "Sex and the City" premiered in 1998, based off of the book written by Candace Bushnell and ran for six seasons. It spawned two films and a prequel TV show called "The Carrie Diaries." "And Just Like That" will consist of 10 episodes.
