(CNN)Tom Holland is a man of his word. He promised a little boy who saved his sister from a dog attack in 2020 that the young Spider-Man fan could visit the "Spider-Man: No Way Home" set and he did just that. Bridger Walker was just 6 years old when he jumped into action to save his 4-year-old sister. The siblings were playing outside their Wyoming home when a German shepherd mix charged toward Walker's sister and he intervened. He subsequently underwent a two-hour surgery that required more than 90 stitches, according to his family in a statement to CNN at the time of the July 2020 incident. Celebrities like Anne Hathaway, Chris Evans, Mark Ruffalo and Holland sent messages both on social media and privately to Walker, praising him for his courage. Holland invited him to do some real-life web slinging. Walker's father shared images and a video from the set visit. In one post, Walker is seen doing a stunt with Holland who is dressed in his Spider-Man suit.
