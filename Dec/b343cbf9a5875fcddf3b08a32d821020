(CNN)The Senate voted on Thursday to advance a bill to create a fast-track process allowing Democrats to raise the federal debt limit, a crucial next step as lawmakers race the clock to avert a catastrophic debt default. To get there, the plan's supporters needed to break a GOP filibuster, which required 60 votes to succeed. The vote tally was 64 to 36, meaning 14 Senate Republicans crossed the aisle to vote with Democrats, who control only 50 seats in the chamber. These are the 14 Senate Republicans who crossed the aisle to vote to advance the debt limit fast-track process bill: John Thune of South DakotaMitch McConnell of KentuckyJohn Barrasso of WyomingRoger Wicker of MississippiShelley Moore Capito of West VirginiaSusan Collins of MaineRoy Blunt of MissouriThom Tillis of North CarolinaLisa Murkowski of AlaskaRichard Burr of North Carolina Joni Ernst of Iowa John Cornyn of TexasMitt Romney of UtahRob Portman of Ohio
