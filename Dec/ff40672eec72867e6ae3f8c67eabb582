(CNN)Sometimes dreams do come true. A 46-year-old woman from Kalamazoo County, Michigan, won a $300,000 lottery jackpot after having previously dreamed it would happen.  The woman, who is choosing to remain anonymous, won playing the Cashword Multiplier scratch-off game, which she bought from a Citgo gas station in Kalamazoo. "Years ago, I had a dream that I won $25,000 playing Cashword," the woman told Michigan Lottery officials when she claimed her prize this week. "I never, ever thought I would actually hit this big, but it's a great feeling!" The lucky player said she plans to use the winnings to buy a new home and will invest what's left. "I don't know anyone who has won big on a Lottery game, so I never really thought it actually happened," she said. "I sure am glad I was wrong!" Since launching in June, Cashword Multiplier has paid out more than $15 million in prizes, according to the Michigan Lottery. More than $17 million in prizes remain.
