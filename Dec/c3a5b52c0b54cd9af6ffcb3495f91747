Americans are facing long lines to get tested for the coronavirus amid a new surge driven by the Omicron variant. During a speech this week, US President Joe Biden aimed to reassure vaccinated Americans that they can still proceed with their holiday plans. "I know some Americans are wondering if you can safely celebrate the holidays with your family and friends. The answer is yes you can if you and those you celebrate with are vaccinated, particularly if you've gotten your booster shot," Biden said Tuesday. The Omicron variant has now been detected in every US state and health officials warn more people are expected to get infected  -- even those who are fully vaccinated -- as they gather for the holidays. Here are some of the other stories that made headlines over the past week, as well as some photos that caught our eye.
