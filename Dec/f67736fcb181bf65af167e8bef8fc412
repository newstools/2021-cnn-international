(CNN)Republican Rep. Devin Nunes of California announced Monday he'll leave the House in the coming weeks to become CEO of the Trump Media & Technology Group. "I'm writing to let you know I've decided to pursue this opportunity, and therefore I will be leaving the House of Representatives at the end of 2021," Nunes said in a letter to his constituents. Moments after his statement, the Trump Media & Technology Group released its own saying Nunes would be its chief executive officer. Nunes, who faced the threat of a more-Democratic district through redistricting ahead of next year's midterms, is a close ally of former President Donald Trump. He previously served as chairman of the House Intelligence Committee when Republicans were in the majority, during which he led efforts among Trump's allies to discredit the FBI's Russia investigation and Special Counsel Robert Mueller's probe. Nunes was also an outspoken defender of Trump during his first impeachment, and the then-President awarded Nunes the Medal of Freedom in January. Trump praised Nunes in the media group's statement, calling him "a fighter and a leader." "He will make an excellent CEO of TMTG," Trump said. Nunes' role as an attack dog against the Russia probe raised his popularity among Trump's supporters, and he became a top fundraiser in the House GOP conference as he gained stature on the right. Rep. Elise Stefanik, the House GOP conference chair and third ranking House Republican, congratulated Nunes, tweeting, "Devin had a spine of steel and an unyielding commitment to fighting for the truth and the Constitution as Chairman and Republican Leader of the House Intelligence Committee. America is forever grateful." This story has been updated with additional developments Monday. CNN's Jeremy Herb contributed to this report.
