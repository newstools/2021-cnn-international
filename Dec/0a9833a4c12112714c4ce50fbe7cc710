The Post added that he had in the past been treated for heart issues. "We will miss Fred's intellect and enthusiasm, his extraordinary leadership, and his unparalleled decency," Ryan wrote in a memo. Ryan described Hiatt as a forty-year veteran of the newspaper who "built friendships throughout the company and made immense contributions as a writer, an editor, and a mentor across the organization.'

Some employees at the Post took to Twitter to grieve Hiatt's passing. "I have had a few truly wonderful bosses in my life," columnist Megan McArdle tweeted.
