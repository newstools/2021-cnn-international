(CNN)Ryan Reynolds keeps getting mistaken for Ben Affleck and he's totally fine with it. The "Deadpool" star and Canadian national tresure explained the mix up during a conversation on the "Dear Hank and John" podcast. "There's a pizza place in the East Village in New York that I've been going to for years," Reynolds said. "They believe I'm Ben Affleck and I've never corrected them. I feel it would not go over well if I revealed." "I do everything normal like everybody else," Reynolds added. "They just think I'm Ben Affleck and they'll ask how J.Lo is and I'm like, 'great, good.' I get the pizza and off I go." When he's not mistaken for Affleck, he adds, he tends to get confused for Ryan Gosling, the other famous Canadian Ryan. "Years ago, I used to play fast and a little loose more on Twitter. These days, I'm a little bit more reserved," he said, before repeating a joke he once quipped about how to tell him apart from Gosling. "I said, 'Well the difference is easy to spot. Ryan Gosling has blond hair and Ryan Reynolds is a [expletive]." Reynolds said if he had starred in "The Notebook" instead of Gosling it would have been a disaster. "That would have failed horrendously," he said. "It would have been worse. I promise you. It would have been unwatchable."
